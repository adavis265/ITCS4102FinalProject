This is a log file that shows what the current goals are for the website that are outlined by the project manager or the client
The three categories are "Waiting On", "Working On" and "Completed"

"Waiting On"
  This category comes from the UML diagrams that are the previous stage of planning for the project
  The UML diagrams outline what is needed in the project and it is from that which you pull tasks from
"Working On"
  This category lists the tasks that are currently being worked on
  You pull tasks from the "Waiting On" category into here and then start working to complete them
"Completed"
  This category lists all of the completed tasks in the order in which they are completed
  This section acts as the log and gives the outline of how the project has changed over time
  Git also tracks changes over time of course, however this file acts as a todo list as well as a mediator between the UML
